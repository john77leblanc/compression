The following figure refers to the position of a character in a chunk of 3 characters.

Figure 1

Positions
000|001|010|100|011|101|110|111
 0   2   3   4   5   6   7   9

Notice that the numbers 1 and 8 are excluded. 

For example, looking at the chunk "aab" we can see that character "a" is found in positions 1 and 2
The associated number to represent the positional data of "a" from the code would be 7 (110)

Examine the following string of characters:
abcbbcdafafaccc

Here it is chunked into segments of 3:
abc|bbc|daf|afa|ccc

If we record the positional data of each character in each segment,
it would look like the following figure:

Figure 2

   Segments
  _1_2_3_4_5
a| 4 0 3 6 0
b| 3 7 0 0 0
c| 2 2 0 0 9
d| 0 0 4 0 0
f| 0 0 2 3 0

Notice that each column has a sum of 9.
With this, we can deduct the positional data of the final character
without needing to record it. Examine the following figure:

Figure 3

   Segments
  _1_2_3_4_5
a| 4 0 3 6 0
b| 3 7 0 0 0
c| 2 2 0 0 9    9 minus
d| 0 0 4 0 0    sum of column thus far
------------    =
f| 0 0 2 3 0    <--

Next, convert the table to a string of positional data in order by column,
excluding the positional data of the final character. Examine the figure:

Figure 4

Columns             | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5
Character Positions |4320|0720|3004|6000|0090

In knowing how many rows there are in the table format,
we can now exclude any "0"s from each column proceeding the sum of 9.
Examine the figure:

Figure 5

Columns             | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5
Character Positions |432 |072 |3004|6000|009

The character positions can now be written into a single string.
Examine the figure:

Figure 6

43207230046000009

Examine the following figure for an association of numbers to letters

Figure 7

0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9
--+---+---+---+---+---+---+--
a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h

Using this association, convert the numerical string into a string of letters.
Examine the following figure:

Figure 8

Since the "a" character will be the most common, any sequence of them write as a number for how many in the sequence.
The character string would then be converted to the following format. Examine the figure:

Figure 9

dcb1gbc2df5h

This new string would then need to be prepended with a key
of the characters included. Use a "." to represent sequential
characters between two characters. Use a "/" to represent the
end of the key. Examine the figure:
